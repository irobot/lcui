# What

Interactive UIs that can be helpful when thinking through a couple of popular coding problems.

* [Scramble String](https://leetcode.com/problems/scramble-string/description/)
* [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/)

> __Note__: If you're determined on solving these problems completely on your own, you may want to steer clear.

I've tried to avoid including spoilers as much as possible.
However, the UI layout itself may be giving away some important considerations.

Enable "Show Hints" as needed.
